public static final String CHECKING/SAVING
final means that this value cant be changed. static means it is accessible from outside class. These two values should be always used when the methods, deposit and withdraw, are invoked. They belong in the "String account" parameter. This is a common way you can ensure the the user uses the correct String.

Class requirements:
The class should be able to use the deposit method deposit amounts into checking or saving balance.
It should create a new deposit object and add it to the list of deposits. The display deposits should have the following output for each deposit:
Deposit of: $400.0 Date: Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 PDT 2018 into account: Checking
Withdraw method and display should work the same
Do no forget to check overdraft for withdraw method.
